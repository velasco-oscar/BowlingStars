# VR Bowling

VR Bowling is a virtual reality bowling game developed in just 1 days for the GAMACON videogame convention (this was not a hackathon). This experimental project combines the classic thrill of bowling with the immersive power of VR, pushing creative boundaries even under tight time constraints.

## About the Project

Born from the challenge of delivering something innovative on a shoestring schedule, VR Bowling represents a spirited attempt to marry traditional gameplay with modern technology. Although the game isn’t 100% finished, it offers a fun and immersive experience that I’m proud to share. This project also marks my first experience using Unity, which added an extra layer of learning and experimentation to the process.

## Key Features

- **Immersive 3D Environment:** Step into a fully-realized virtual space that brings the excitement of bowling to life.
- **Intuitive VR Controls:** Designed for a smooth and engaging experience, the controls are easy to pick up, making the game accessible even for newcomers.
- **Evolving Prototype:** While the game is playable, it’s still a work in progress. Several features and visual elements are under refinement.

## Project Status

It’s important to note that VR Bowling is a prototype.

## Installation and Execution

1. **System Requirements:**
   - A compatible virtual reality device.
   - VR controllers and accessories as required by your specific setup.
   - An internet connection for downloading updates and additional resources.

2. **How to Run the Game:**

## Final Notes

Developed solely by one individual under intense time constraints, VR Bowling is a labor of love that explores the potential of VR gaming with limited resources. This project was particularly challenging and rewarding as it was my first time using Unity. While still a work in progress, I’m incredibly proud of what I managed to achieve in just 1 day. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions to further enhance and expand the experience!
